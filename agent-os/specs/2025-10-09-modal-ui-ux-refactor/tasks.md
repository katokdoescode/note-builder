# Task Breakdown: Modal UI/UX Refactor

## Overview
Total Tasks: 10
Assigned roles: ui-designer, testing-engineer

## Strategic Ordering Notes
Tasks are ordered from easiest to hardest with careful dependency management:
1. CSS foundation first (non-breaking, isolated changes)
2. Reusable components next (can test independently)
3. Apply to one modal as proof of concept
4. Replicate to other modals
5. Complex state management and edge cases last

2. **Phase 2:** Timer Component (Task Group 2) - Build first reusable component
3. **Phase 2:** Button Layout (Task Group 3) - Create horizontal layout structure
4. **Phase 3:** Progressive Disclosure (Task Group 4) - Add show/hide functionality
5. **Phase 4:** Loading States (Task Group 5) - Add visual feedback
6. **Phase 4:** Dirty State (Task Group 6) - Implement data loss prevention
7. **Phase 5:** MemoModal (Task Group 7) - Apply everything to first modal
8. **Phase 5:** Other Modals (Task Group 8) - Replicate to remaining modals
9. **Phase 6:** Accessibility (Task Group 9) - Add comprehensive a11y features
10. **Phase 7:** Testing (Task Group 10) - Complete test coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **CSS conflicts**: Test in isolation first, use scoped classes
- **State management complexity**: Build incrementally, test each piece
- **Performance impacts**: Profile timer and animations early
- **Browser compatibility**: Test core features early across browsers

### Implementation Strategy
- Start with easiest, non-breaking changes (CSS)
- Build and test components in isolation
- Apply to one modal first as proof of concept
- Replicate proven patterns to other modals
- Leave complex testing and edge cases for last
