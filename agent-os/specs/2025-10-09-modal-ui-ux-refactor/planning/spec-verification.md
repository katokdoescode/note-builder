**Task Specificity:**
Checking for vague vs. specific tasks:
- Task 1.2: Specific - "Delete .inner-glowing class and keyframes"
- Task 2.4: Specific - "Format as MM:SS for recordings under 60 minutes"
- Task 3.3: Specific - "Add restart button as first in group (40px size)"

- Task 5.3: Specific - "Apply to mic button during recording"
- Task 6.4: Specific - "Show confirmation: 'You have unsaved changes. Are you sure?'"
- Task 7.2: Specific - "Replace vertical left-side buttons"
- All tasks include concrete acceptance criteria
- STATUS: ALL TASKS SPECIFIC AND ACTIONABLE

**Traceability to Requirements:**

- Task Group 6 → requirements.md lines 132-134 (dirty state)
- Task Group 7-8 → Apply to all modals (lines 186-189)
- Task Group 9 → requirements.md lines 149-156 (accessibility)
- Task Group 10 → requirements.md lines 205-230 (testing/edge cases)
- STATUS: ALL TASKS TRACEABLE

**Scope Verification:**
No tasks found for out-of-scope items:
- No tasks modifying API integration
- No tasks changing core functionality
- No tasks adding new modal types
- All tasks focused on UI/UX refactoring
- STATUS: SCOPE PROPERLY BOUNDED

**Visual Alignment:**
- Task 7.2 line 278: "Reference: planning/visuals/Create-memo-modal.png"
- Task 7.8 line 303: "Verify against visual mockup"
- Task 8.2 line 327: "Reference: planning/visuals/Custom-prompt-modal.png"
- Task 8.3 line 335: "Reference: planning/visuals/Smart-memo-modal.png"

- STATUS: APPROPRIATE TASK GRANULARITY

**Ordering (Easiest to Hardest):**
User explicitly requested: "Order tasks from easiest to hardest"
Verification of actual ordering:
1. Phase 1 (Task Group 1): CSS foundation - EASIEST (pure CSS, no logic)
2. Phase 2 (Task Groups 2-3): Reusable components - EASY-MEDIUM (isolated)
3. Phase 3 (Task Group 4): Progressive disclosure - MEDIUM (state-based)
4. Phase 4 (Task Groups 5-6): Loading and dirty state - MEDIUM-HARD (complex state)
5. Phase 5 (Task Groups 7-8): Apply to modals - MEDIUM (integration)
6. Phase 6 (Task Group 9): Accessibility - MEDIUM (comprehensive features)
7. Phase 7 (Task Group 10): Testing - HARD (full coverage, edge cases)

tasks.md lines 7-13 explicitly document this ordering strategy:
"Tasks are ordered from easiest to hardest with careful dependency management"

STATUS: PROPERLY ORDERED AS REQUESTED

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
PASSED - No over-engineering detected

**Unnecessary New Components:**
Checking if new components are justified:
- Button Group Component (spec.md line 84): JUSTIFIED - changing from vertical to horizontal layout
- Recording Timer Component (line 85): JUSTIFIED - new feature requested by user
- Progressive Section Component (line 86): JUSTIFIED - new feature requested by user
- Loading Button Component (line 87): JUSTIFIED - new feature requested by user
- Dirty State Manager (line 88): JUSTIFIED - new feature requested by user
- STATUS: ALL NEW COMPONENTS JUSTIFIED

**Duplicated Logic:**
Checking for recreation of existing patterns:
- AudioRecorder: MAINTAINED (spec.md line 76, no changes)
- OpenAI integration: MAINTAINED (spec.md line 77, no changes)
- Modal structure: MAINTAINED (spec.md lines 71-75)
- Drag-and-drop: MAINTAINED (spec.md line 79)
- File upload: MAINTAINED (spec.md line 80)
- STATUS: NO DUPLICATION FOUND

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
User did not mention any similar features or existing code to reuse. Spec appropriately:
- Maintains existing AudioRecorder (line 76)
- Maintains OpenAI integration (line 77)
- Keeps existing modal patterns (lines 71-81)
- Extends Notice() usage (line 81)
- STATUS: NO OPPORTUNITIES MISSED

**Justification for New Code:**
All new code justified by explicit user requirements:
- New CSS classes: Replacing old animations, adding new layouts
- New timer component: User requested live recording timer
- New progressive disclosure: User requested hidden-by-default textareas
- New loading states: User requested animation feedback
- New dirty state: User requested data loss prevention
- STATUS: ALL NEW CODE JUSTIFIED

**Over-Engineering Check:**
Examining spec for unnecessary complexity:
- No complex state management library introduced
- No unnecessary abstractions
- No framework additions (React, Vue, etc.)
- Pure CSS animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Simple state tracking in modal classes
- STATUS: NO OVER-ENGINEERING DETECTED
