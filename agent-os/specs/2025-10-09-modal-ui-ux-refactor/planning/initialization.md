# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Refactor all modals (MemoModal, CustomCommandModal, SmartMemoModal) for consistent UI/UX with:
- Reorganized button layout (restart/record/upload centered at top)
- Progressive disclosure (textareas hidden until processing)
- Live recording timer with state indicators
- Unified styling system
- Loading state indicators on buttons
- Mobile responsiveness (95vh)
- Data loss prevention (confirm on close with changes)
- New animations replacing old glowing effects

This is a UI/UX refactoring that maintains all existing functionality while improving consistency and user feedback.
