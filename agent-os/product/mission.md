# Note Builder - Product Mission

## Vision

Note Builder transforms how knowledge workers capture and organize their thoughts by enabling seamless voice-to-text note creation within Obsidian. We eliminate the friction between having an idea and having a structured, actionable note.

## Mission Statement

Empower Obsidian users to capture thoughts, ideas, and tasks effortlessly through voice input, leveraging AI to transform raw speech into structured, meaningful notes that integrate seamlessly into their knowledge management workflow.

## Core Problems Solved

### 1. Capture Friction
**Problem**: Typing on mobile or while multitasking creates friction that causes ideas to be lost.
**Solution**: Quick voice recording with one command, works on both desktop and mobile.

### 2. Unstructured Voice Notes
**Problem**: Raw voice recordings are difficult to search, reference, and integrate into note systems.
**Solution**: AI-powered transcription and automatic structuring into summaries, tasks, and reflex notes.

### 3. Context Switching
**Problem**: Users must leave Obsidian to use voice-to-text tools, breaking their workflow.
**Solution**: Fully integrated plugin that keeps users in their Obsidian environment.

### 4. Inflexible Output Formats
**Problem**: Generic transcription tools don't understand note-taking context or user preferences.
**Solution**: Customizable prompts and output formats for different note types (summaries, tasks, reflections).
